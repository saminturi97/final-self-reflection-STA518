# STA518-self-reflection
## STA 518 Objectives:- 
Import, manage, and clean data 
  
  I can import data from a variety of sources.
  
  I can isolate information from a larger data source.
  
  I can combine information from multiple data sources.
  
  I can restructure information to be in a “tidy” format.
  
  I can transform information to be in a format better suited for specific tasks.

Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations
  
  I can create tables of numerical summaries that draw attention to important comparisons.
  
  I can create graphical displays of data that highlight key features.
  
  I can combine multiple graphical displays or numerical summaries into an effective data product.

Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments
  
  I can write a function that accomplishes a common analysis task.
  
  I can apply a function to groupings within a data source.
  
  I can implement resampling methods to make conclusions about data.
  
  I can use common probability distributions to simulate data and explore statistical ideas.  
  
  I can fit a regression model for descriptive analysis.

Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.
  
  I can identify and correct common errors and in R programs.
  
  I can explore new functions or packages and implement them into analyses.
  
  I can identify and correct common collaboration errors when working with Git/GitHub.

Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs
  
  I can use a project-based workflow to organize and run reproducible analyses.
  
  I can write professional reports using R Markdown.
  
  I can call a separate R script containing self-created functions to then be used within an analysis.
  
  I can write comments that explain the “why” (Why did you choose this approach instead of an alternative? What else did you try that didn’t work?) of my code.
